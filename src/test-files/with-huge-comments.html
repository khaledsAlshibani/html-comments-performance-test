HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.
The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.

  <!-- 
    The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.
    It contains metadata information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS),
    links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document).
    Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML document correctly.

  -->
  <head>
    <!-- 
      The meta tag is used to define the metadata of the page.

      Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document — the <meta> element.
      Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata too.
      There are a lot of different types of <meta> elements that can be included in your page's <head>, but we won't try to explain them all at this stage, as it would just get too confusing.
      Instead, we'll explain a few things that you might commonly see, just to give you an idea.

    <!-- 
      This attribute declares the document's character encoding.
      If the attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for the string "utf-8", because UTF-8 is the only valid encoding for HTML5 documents.
      <meta> elements which declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the document.

      The browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen.
      This is often not the same size as the rendered page, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.

      Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual window or viewport, which is usually wider than the screen, and then shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once. Users can then zoom and pan to look more closely at different areas of the page. For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be rendered with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk down to fit into the 640px space.

      This is done because not all pages are optimized for mobile and break (or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport width.
      This virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general look better on narrow screen devices.

      However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using media queries — if the virtual viewport is 980px for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or 480px or less will never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design techniques.
      The viewport <meta> element mitigates this problem of virtual viewport on narrow screen devices.

      The title tag is used to define the title of the page.

      The contents of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization (SEO).
      In general, a longer, descriptive title performs better than short or generic titles.
      The content of the title is one of the components used by search engine algorithms to decide the order in which to list pages in search results.
      Also, the title is the initial "hook" by which you grab the attention of readers glancing at the search results page.

        Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing </p> tag.

        <section> is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it.
        As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <nav> element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a <section>.
